int ls[logN], int rs[logN] -> these are the 'stacks'

left=ls[sp], right = rs[sp--];

pivot = part(a, left, right)

ls[++sp] = left, rs[sp]= pivot-1
ls[++sp] = pivot+1, rs[sp] = right;
if right -left >1 continue, else is already sorted 
    - (assuming right is smallerthan left)
do while stackPointer is > 0
